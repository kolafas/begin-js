## Music Genres
---------------
   Music can be simply put as an art or cultural activity that makes use of sound and silence. It obviously of course has its own categories which are reffered to as genres. A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.
   There are basically three acceptable genres according to Musicologists which are as follows:
 1. [Art Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/Art_Music)
 2. [Popular Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/Popular_Music)
 3. [Traditional music](https://en.wikipedia.org/Traditional_Music)
